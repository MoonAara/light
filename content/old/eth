No ??? asked.

-> Feel free to ask questions. 

How do I submit a module?

> submit module [github-url] (as [team])

The first module is called module. Use it like:

    module>

You can search for module ideas. You can start repos.

The source code for module> is at [url].

You can copy the structure of that for your own module.

How do I make a team?

> [team name]: team of [name,..]
