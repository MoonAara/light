# me, reading implied

I'm writing an entire infrastructure as a client-side application for the sake of rapid development and experimentation. 

Others may translate this into an actual server deployment.

You may only do this with my permission. I insist on this simply because the purpose of this project is unification. I promise if you talk to me I'll let you do your good thing. I'm nice. Email me at aara.us.

To run locally:

> ./dev

First time, run `sudo npm install` first.

The rest is explained at http://localhost:8422.
