# me, reading implied

I'm Moon Aara.

You have a different name.

You have different friends.

Your tastes are different.

Your dream is different.

This is a light document platform that seeks to accomodate these differences. 

Entering text is the most basic part of using the internet. This seeks to get that right in an open, infinitely extensible way. Once we've perfected composing, sharing, and organizing text, everything else we want to do on the internet becomes easier.  

## this

I'm writing an entire infrastructure as a client-side application for the sake of rapid development and experimentation. It includes its own database model, and a testing environment for measuring your experiments against others. You're free to develop and experiment with this however you'd like.

The mock infrastructure here can simply be translated into an actual server deployment. You may only do this with my permission. I insist on this simply because the purpose of this project is unification. I promise if you talk to me I'll let you do your good thing. I'm nice. Email me at aara.us.

To run locally:

> ./dev.sh

This will automatically rebuild the code every time you save a file. Sometimes you'll have to re-run ./dev.sh. 

First time, run `sudo npm install` first.

Main code is in src/web/client/{main.js,light/}.

The rest is explained at http://localhost:8422.
